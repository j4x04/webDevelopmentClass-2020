### Routing in React
* Browser Router  
Browser router is a react extension/package that allows you to route different sites using a router. 
* Hash Router  
Hash router is like browser router (react, etc.) but it works from the client side- all the routes are sitname.com/#/extension, so the server doesn't have to handle these. 
* Static Routing 
Static routing is a way of directing a site to different pages by declaring the routes before the initialization of the app and before any of the rendering/functions take place. 
* Dynamic Routing     
Dynamic routing does the same thing, except it takes place during the rendering and function of the app, not before.
