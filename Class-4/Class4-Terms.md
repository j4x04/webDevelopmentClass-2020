### CSS Basic Component Styling
* snake_case  
Style for writing which everything is lowercase and words are separated by an underscore _. 
* kebab-case  
Style for writing code in which everything is lowercase and words are separated by a dash -. 
* camelCase  
Style for writing in which words are separated by a capital on the first letter of the next word, not including the first word. 
* css class   
A class selector in css corresponds with the HTML class, and is written using the format .class 
* style base on state  
React can change style selectors using different states to update components- style can be based on the state a component is in. 
* combining selectors  
You can combine selectors to specify what to apply style to (.class1 .class2) will only apply to the class 2 component contained in a class 1 div. You can also do (.class1 .p) or other types of components- this will apply to all \<p>\</p> tags in class 1. 
* external style sheet   
CSS is usually written in its own file and linked in the head section of an HTML file. Separate CSS files are external style sheets. 
* internal style sheet  
You can also add raw css using \<style>\</style> tags in the \<head>\</head> tags of an html file. This is in the html file, so it is an internal style sheet. 
* inline style  
For each component, you can add \<style> in the parameters of a component. For example, you can write \<div class = "class1" style = "x:y">\</div> and it will apply that style onto that component only. 
* margin vs padding  
Margin refers to space around the element that other things cannot be in, while padding is the space between an element and the content inside of it. 
* px vs rem vs em  
Pixels (px) is a standard unit that will be constant no matter the platform. Em and rem are flexible similar to percentages, so for example if something took up 50% of the screen it would only take up 50% whether on a laptop or on a phone.
