### Functional Component and useState Hook
* Class Component   
A class component is a component that is structured like a class- it has different parts and functions that happen in the class. 
* Stateful Component  
Stateful components are just components that include state (so it can represent changing data, not just what is given to it through a prop.)
* Functional Component  
Functional components are written as a function (replacing the class.)
* Stateless Component   
Stateless components do not have states, so they use props for any required information. 
* Hooks  
React hooks will activate at certain points within the process of an app- and running whatever is inside of the function when the hook is triggered. 
* useEffect  
useEffect is a hook similar to the lifecycle hook componenthasUpdated. It is included in the react package and used in functional components. 
* useState   
useState is a hook that declares variable(s)/functions at the beginning of the component process.
