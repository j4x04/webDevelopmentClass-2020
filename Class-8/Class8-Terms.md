### RESTFUL API
* RESTful API  
Restful API uses different input types (GET, POST, etc. ) to communicate and transfer/manipulate data between two pieces of software using endpoints. 
* Http 1.1 vs Http2  
Http 1.1 has to load resources (files, etc.) separately while Http 2 is much faster (and effective) using a single method to transfer multiple streams of data. 
* Http vs Https  
Https is the same as http in terms of function, but https includes encryption (protection) for data during the transfer to the user. 
* GET, PUT, POST, PATCH and DELETE  
These are different methods of changing data- GET will return resources, POST will create resources, PUT will update resources by appending, PATCH will update and modify resources, and DELETE will remove them. 
* Request Parameter / Query String  
Within a url, there will often be different parameters to a request to specify which and what function an endpoint will perform - a query string is often one of these parameters asking for data related to that query stirng. 
* Request Header  
Request headers are included in the urls and often specify endpoints, but don't have any of the actual content requested. 
* Request Body  
The request body is the actual data that is transferred using endpoints (a common example of a request body is in the form of json)
* Response code (2XX, 4XX, 5XX)  
Response codes are used and included to specify and note down certain things- 2xx indicates success, 4xx includes different client errors, such as conflict or forbidden, and 5xx indicates a server error. 
* Response status  
The response status is described by the response codes (see one above) about the "state" of the request. 
* Response data  
Response data describes the details and data of the response
* Response message  
The message entails most different things, including the data and status. 
* Swagger
