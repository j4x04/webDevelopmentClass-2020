#### Version Control

#### Git
Git is a version control software that saves and tracks changes to files. It can be used to save your own files, or used to track changes of files among multiple people. 
#### GitHub
Github is a company that utilises the git software to build a version control sites. It is one of the platforms that allows you to save you files to their server. 
#### Repository 
A repository is a place where code and other files can be stored. Individual files, classes, or entire packages of software can be stored here. 
#### Git Branch
Git branches are ways to identify changes you make while not touching the previous version. If you make any change to the code, you can create a different branch to isolate the change and make sure it works. 
#### Pull Request 
When you finish making changes to a branch of the project, you can ask for a pull request, which means that the code will be contributed towards the actual project (main repository).
#### Git Pull
Git pull is a command that basically creates a pull request. If you are the owner of the repository, it will update the repo. 
#### Git Commit 
All changes you make to your computer only save to your local files- using git commit will save these changes to the local repository. 
#### Git Push
Git push will take all the committed changes in your local repository and push it onto the online/remote repository. 
#### Git Conflict
Git can merge commits when they do not affect each  other. However, if there are two or more changes that interfere with each other, it creates a git conflict where it cannot merge. A person has to resolve this conflict, git cannot do it.
#### Git Rebase 
Git rebase is similar to the merge command, but it will rewrite the history of commits to make it neater and more organized. It can compress all the changes into one "patch". 


### VS Code Related
#### IDE
An integrated development environment is an application that assists with developing code. Some IDEs can be as simple as a text editor, while others may include compiliers and interpreters for testing the code you write. 
#### Text Editor
Text editors allow you to easily modify text inside of files- more useful ones will include different features for different purposes (for example, most code IDEs will automatically complete brackets, or will have certain keywords like "var" highlighted in different colours). 


### Terminal Command Basic 
#### cd (change directory)
The change directory command allows you to move into different directories (mostly shown as folders on a desktop interface). All other commands, such as ls, mkdir and rm will then only apply to the current directory you are in. You can use it with the format cd \<Directory Name> to go into that director, or use "cd ..". 
#### ls (list directory)
The ls command lists all the computer files in the current directory. To use it, use the cd command to navigate into the directory, and then type ls.
#### rm (remove file)
The rm command removes files depending on what you specify. It also has modifers, allowing you to type "rm -i" to ask you for comfirmation before deleting files, or "rm -f", which forcibly deletes them without asking. 

### Web Development Related 
#### Frontend 
The front end is the part of the project that will be seen by the target audience/consumer. It is the "aesthetics" of the site, and is (for the web) mostly created using CSS and HTML. For example, the colour and positioning of a button or piece of text is all front end. 
#### Backend 
The back end is the part that is used for all the functionality of a website. For example, when you press a button, the action the button does (plays a round, creates a popup, etc.) is all back end development. It will usually be developed using scripting language such as PHP or javascript. 
#### HTML
HTML (Hypertext markup language) is a language for web development. It uses different tags such as  \<title> to show different "elements". 
#### CSS Style 
CSS (cascading style sheets) is mainly used to modify the elements in HTML to look better. For example, it can be used to modify positioning, size, colour, or font, of any buttons or other elements in the HTML. 
#### Javascript
Javascript is one of the main scripting languages used in the back end. It is a scripting language, meaning that it has the usual variables / data structures, etc. of a programming language. 
#### API
An API (application programming interface) describes the interactions between different softwares. It functions mostly on an input/output system, where calling an API with xyz input will lead to the API spitting out an "output" in whatever form to be used. In this way, one software application can use the code or processes in another application. 
#### Endpoint
An endpoint is a specific place used to create interactions wiht different parties. For example, the interaction between a web server and your computer takes place in the endpoint of the URL of that website. APIs have endpoints too, where if an application wants to access another, it has to specify the endpoint because different endpoints are tied to different functions. 
#### React 
React is a javascript library used for building UIs (user interfaces). This means it comes with specific commands that were developed to specifically create front end as well. 
#### Node.js
Node javascript allows you to access and run javascript programming outside of a webpage. It has libraries that allow it to be used as a front end or back end, and is incredibly flexible. 
#### NPM
NPM is the node package manager that is used uniquely for node javascript. It contains packages by whoever wants to publish them, and these packages include useful commands that you can add to your javascript (as long as you specify the packages as dependencies). For example, there is a package that allows you to read and write to text files, or will provide a huge library of fonts.
