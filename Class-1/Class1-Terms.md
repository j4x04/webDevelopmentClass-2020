### General JS
* JavaScript   
Javascript is a programming language that is commonly used for web development because of its compatibility with HTML and CSS. It also has libraries and packages that assist with its usage.   

* Arrow function  
An arrow function is just a regular function but made shorter (more concise) by the syntax "=>" accomadated with modified versions of the normal bracketing. 

* let variable   
The let keyword declares a variable, but it is more limited than the var keyword. This means that the let keyword will declare a variable that is limited by the structure it is in (if you declare a variable using let in a loop, the variable can only be accessed in the loop)

* const variable  
Constant variables are assigned a value when declared that cannot be changed. (const pi = 3.14 means that pi will always equal 3.14) This is true of all constant primitive types, but constant objects behave differently (you can change and add different properties, but you cannot entirely reassign it).

* ES5 vs ES6 vs ES7  
ES5/6/7 are all updates and versions of javascript as it is written and updated. ES5 contained a large update including array type structures, ES6 added a signficiant amount, arrows, classes, new APIs being among the most important, and ES7 is the year where it was decided to release annual updates (meaning no more massive releases like ES6). 


### React Related
* JavaScript Framework  
This is essentially a framework built for javascript. A framework is typically a "frame" with already existing code written that can be modified in order to achieve what the developer wants. In essence, it can be seen as a version of a "fill in the blanks". 

* JavaScript Library   
A javascript library is a collection of commands and other resources that a developer can use to work on his/her project. It is different from a framework because the developer can choose where and how to use each resource, compared to a framework which uses them in certain places and tells the developer to modify only certain sections. 

* Single Page Web Application   
A Single Page application is one that is accessed by changing the content of the page and often entirely "rewriting" itself for the purpose of the user. This is compared to other pages, where you can navigate to multiple different pages (which don't rewrite itself). 

* React   
React is a javscript library used for building front end user interfaces- specifically single page web applications. (It is not a framework:) )

* JSX  
JSX is a type of syntax used by react to facilitate and simplify different pieces of code. Instead of putting Javascript into HTML using a script tag, it puts the html into the javascript. 

* Babel Transcompiler   
Babel (free & open source) is used to compile newer ECMAScript so that even older engines can run it. 

* Webpack bundler   
This basically packages and "bundles" javascript for usage, whether it be in (usually) browser or for other reasons. 

* Create-React-App  
This is to create a react app. (Web Application)
