### React General
* State  
  State is used within react as an internal component. Basically, most objects (text, buttons) will have a "state", and if they are changed, the "state" will update. If the text on a component changes, the "state" is updated. 
* Props    
  Props actually is short form for "properties", and they should not be modified (immutable). 
* Class Component   
  A class component is created by defining a function as a class. This also means you can use setState because it is not a function. 
* Functional Component  
  Functional components are not defined as classes; they are simply functions written in javascript. 
* Why use functional component   
  Even though functional components miss out on alot of different things available to class components, functional components are often easier for development because it is plain javascript without state hooks and also sometimes less code.
