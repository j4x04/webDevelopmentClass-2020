### Async Actions with Redux Thunk
* Async Actions  
Asynchronous pieces of code have no order to them, and will finish whatever line of code is the fastest in that section. 
* Action Creator  
These are redux functions that create actions that will be called and dispatched within the framework of redux. 
* Redux Thunk   
Redux thunk is a type of redux middleware that allow you to return a function instead of an object. It is especially useful for API calls. 
* Redux middleware  
Redux middlware is asynchronous, and functions as as intermediate point between the dispatch and the reducer where the values/actions can be modified. Different middleware can do different things.
